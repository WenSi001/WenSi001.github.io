title:  Twitter Data Analysis and Visualization

I used both API and non-API method to get Twitter data. The data is tweets information of "CDCgov". For the non-API method, I conducted tweets of "CDCgov" from Janauary 2020 to June 2020. And for the API method, I conducted 1500 tweets of "CDCgov" and 1500 tweets for the related topic "COVID-19".

1. For the non-API method, the data file is attached [here](https://github.com/WenSi001/WenSi001.github.io/blob/master/cdc.csv).

The results of the non-API method shows as follows:

2.  For the API method, I conducted a search of twitter data by username and keyword. The username is "CDCgov" and the keyword is "COVID-19". The igraph for both username and keyword is conducted on Monday June 15th at 11am.

The igraph for "CDCgov" shows as follows:
