I used both API and non-API method to get Twitter data. The data is tweets information of "CDCgov". For the non-API method, I conducted tweets of "CDCgov" from Janauary 2020 to June 2020. And for the API method, I conducted 1500 tweets of "CDCgov" and 1500 tweets for the related topic "COVID-19".

The results of the non-API method shows as follows:
