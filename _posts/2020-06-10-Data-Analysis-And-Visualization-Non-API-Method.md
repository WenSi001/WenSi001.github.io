I used non-API method to get the data from Twitter, the data is tweets information of "realDonaldTrump" from January 1st, 2020 to June 3rd, 2020. The raw data is [here](https://github.com/WenSi001/WenSi001.github.io/blob/master/realdt.csv).
The results shows as follow:

Also, you can [get the PDF](Wen Si_EPPS 7V81 HW1.pdf) directly to see the sample codes.
