```python
string1 = "First Bit."
space = " "
string2 = "Second Bit."
print(string1 + space + string2)
```

    First Bit. Second Bit.



```python
new_string = "this IS a SliGhtly more ComplicaTed strINg"

new_string[1]         #calls the letter at index position one (i.e. the second letter)
new_string[0:4]       #calls the first four characters
new_string[5:]        #calls everything including and after the fifth character
new_string[::2]       #calls all characters in steps of 2 (i.e. every other character)
new_string[-1:-10:-1] #calls the last ten letters in steps of -1 (i.e. reverse)
```

```python
len(new_string)
string1.lower() #makes it lower case
string1.upper() #makes it upper case
string1.split() #takes each item, puts it in a list as an individual item.
                #TRY THIS. See what happens.

#You can also put strings together via methods other than concatenation:
string4 = "is cool."
string5 = "Programming %s" %string4 #the %s denotes a placeholder for a string.
                                    #this is more useful than it looks.
