```python
a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
```


```python
a == b  # The double equals signifies an " is the same as" comparison.
a != b  # This sigifies a " not the same as" comparison
b > a   # "is greater than"
b >= a  # "is greater than or equal to"
b < a   # "is less than"
b <= a  # "is less than or equal to"
c % a   # "modulo" left over when c divided by a
```

```python
# Question: Calculation within comparisons, guess the results

a + 1 == b
# true

c - 1 >= b

c/4 > a

a*2 == c
